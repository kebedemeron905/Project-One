* The goal of this game is for users to identify/review the title and artist of iconic artworks shown.
* On the landing page, users will see the first artwork displayed. 
* Users can click the correct button on the right if they know the answer, or the wrong button if they donâ€™t. 
* Users can tap on the image to flip and see the correct answer or confirm their answers.
* They can navigate to the next image by clicking on the arrow keys at the bottom of the flash cards


## Items Yet to be Added/Fixed

* The wrong button should deduct score points one card at a time, not always.

* Add a pop-up congratulatory image or message at the end
